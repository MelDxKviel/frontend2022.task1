      <p class="content__text">
        Philosophy is the systematized study of general and fundamental
        questions, such as those about existence, reason, knowledge, values,
        mind, and language. Such questions are often posed as problems to be
        studied or resolved. Some sources claim the term was coined by
        Pythagoras. Others dispute this story, arguing that Pythagoreans
        merely claimed use of a preexisting term. Philosophical methods
        include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and
        systematic presentation.

      <h2 class="content__title">Definitions</h2>
      <p class="content__text">
        There is wide agreement that philosophy (from the ancient Greek φίλος,
        phílos: "love"; and σοφία, sophía: "wisdom") is characterized by
        various general features: it is a form of rational inquiry, it aims to
        be systematic, and it tends to critically reflect on its own methods
        and presuppositions. But approaches that go beyond such vague
        characterizations to give a more interesting or profound definition
        are usually controversial. Often, they are only accepted by theorists
        belonging to a certain philosophical movement and are revisionistic in
        that many presumed parts of philosophy would not deserve the title
        "philosophy" if they were true. Before the modern age, the term was
        used in a very wide sense, which included the individual sciences,
        like physics or mathematics, as its sub-disciplines, but the
        contemporary usage is more narrow.

      <h2 class="content__title">Historical overwiew</h2>
      <p class="content__text">
        In one general sense, philosophy is associated with wisdom,
        intellectual culture, and a search for knowledge. In this sense, all
        cultures and literate societies ask philosophical questions, such as
        "how are we to live" and "what is the nature of reality". A broad and
        impartial conception of philosophy, then, finds a reasoned inquiry
        into such matters as reality, morality, and life in all world
        civilizations.

      <h2 class="content__title">Western philosophy</h2>
      <p class="content__text">
        Western philosophy is the philosophical tradition of the Western
        world, dating back to pre-Socratic thinkers who were active in
        6th-century Greece (BCE), such as Thales (c.624 – c.545 BCE) and
        Pythagoras (c.570 – c.495 BCE) who practiced a 'love of wisdom'
        (Latin: philosophia) and were also termed 'students of nature'
        (physiologoi).
      </p>

      <p class="content__text">Western philosophy can be divided into three eras:</p>
      <ul class="content__text list">
        <li>Ancient (Greco-Roman).</li>
        <li>Medieval philosophy (referring to Christian European thought).</li>
        <li>Modern philosophy (beginning in the 17th century).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="content__title">Middle Eastern philosophy</h2>
      <p class="content__text">
        Jewish philosophy and Christian philosophy are religious-philosophical
        traditions that developed both in the Middle East and in Europe, which
        both share certain early Judaic texts (mainly the Tanakh) and
        monotheistic beliefs. Jewish thinkers such as the Geonim of the
        Talmudic Academies in Babylonia and Maimonides engaged with Greek and
        Islamic philosophy. Later Jewish philosophy came under strong Western
        intellectual influences and includes the works of Moses Mendelssohn
        who ushered in the Haskalah (the Jewish Enlightenment), Jewish
        existentialism, and Reform Judaism.
